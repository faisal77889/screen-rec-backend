Hey there, this is a quick and silly video to allow you to experiment a little bit with
the process of transcription on YouTube.
All I'm looking for you to do here is to use the YouTube tool to transcribe this message
and then click sync and set the timing so you can get a quick idea about how the whole
process works.
Well, this wraps up the video, good luck, and I will talk to you about it soon.
